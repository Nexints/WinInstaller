If you find this document, deployment of this OS has been successful.

Some things to note:
The install method used is unintentional, while working may change later.
This script relies on the legacy "xcopy". 

IMPORTANT:
Modify the script for yourself to install your own apps! This installer is currently compatible with AdoptOpenJDK, Davinci Resolve, Windows 10 Debloater, Osu, Steam, Firefox, Notepad++, OBS, Steam, Libreoffice, paint++, and Crystal Disk Mark. However, we have used fake names for these files, as I'm not allowed to personally distribute versions of these installers.

Find these installers for yourself and download them off the internet, or use versions you already have!

.fake files are EXE files you have to find manually.
.fakemsi are MSI files you need to find manually.
.changeme is the custom background you will be using. This is optional.
Microsoft Edge is automatically deleted, so you will need an internet browser. I don't provide any with this build.
