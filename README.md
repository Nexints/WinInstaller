# WinInstaller
Install windows anywhere, on USB flash drives, and more with our AUTOMATED tools!

# Disclaimers
I don't provide any of the extra language packs, ISO's, or applications myself. Please download them at your own time. I will link the official Microsoft download pages for Windows 10 and 11, but for 8.1 and 7, you are on your own.

Windows 10:

Windows 11:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11
**Select the Windows iso instead of the media creation tools.**

This program has not been properly tested in a production environment. This program's last known working date was at 06/2024 (June of 2024). Be warned.

# How to use:
Click on the "installer.bat" file, and you should be set! This program should only ask for administrator permissions once, and if you accept, will give you access.
