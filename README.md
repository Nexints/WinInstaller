# Disclaimers

**Use this at your own risk. I am not liable for any damages caused.**

I don't provide any of the extra language packs, ISO's, or applications myself. Please download them at your own time. I will link the official Microsoft download pages for Windows 10 and 11, but for 8.1 and 7, you are on your own.

Windows 10:

Windows 11:

**Select the Windows iso instead of the media creation tools.**

This program has not been properly tested in a production environment. This program's last known working date was at 06/2024 (June of 2024). Be warned.

# How to use:
Copy the source code as a zip file, then extract the zip and click on the "installer.bat" file. After the program asks for administrator permissions, follow the on-screen steps and you should be set! This program should only ask for administrator permissions once, and if you accept, will give you access.

# Read This Please.
This is not official Microsoft software, and I have no obligation to support this software anymore. **This software is basically abandonware, but may get an update every few years. Use at your own risk. This software may accidentally nuke your computer if you aren't careful.'**
